The scripts can be run in any order

*Note: The actual outputs for these queries will mostly be pivot tables, but with the column names removed
* Instead, you must simply paste the values of the adjacent table, transposed.
* This is made more apparent once you actually see the either the csv or simply run the queries

*This subquery "concat(b.mth_abrv_nm,'-',substring(b.yr_num,3,2)) as month" is used to get monthly dates into a shorter form
* Ex: '2020-04-01' -> 'Apr-20'
